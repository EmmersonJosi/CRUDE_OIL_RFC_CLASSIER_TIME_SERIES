**Crude oil, often referred to simply as "oil," is a fossil fuel and a natural resource found beneath the Earth's surface.It is a vital energy source and a crucial raw material in various industries. It is commonly processed in refineries to produce various petroleum products, including gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, heating oil, and lubricants. Additionally, crude oil serves as a feedstock for the petrochemical industry, where it is used to produce chemicals and plastics.**

**Objective:In this project we make use of RandomForest Classifier to make a prediction of whether the next week's crude oil's closing price will be higher or lower than the current week.We will deploy a calender based approach for the model i.e we will train our model to focus on the 7th, 14th,21st and the 28th day of the month.**

**Goal: Create a model that predicts whether the Closing price of crude oil in 7 days time will be higher or lower than the Closing price of the current week**
